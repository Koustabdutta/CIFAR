## 🧪 PSEUDO CIFAR – Pseudo Labeling on CIFAR-10 for Semi-Supervised Learning

This notebook explores **pseudo labeling** — a semi-supervised learning technique — applied to the **CIFAR-10** image dataset. The model trains on labeled data and uses its predictions on unlabeled data to improve performance iteratively.

### 🧠 Key Features
- Semi-supervised learning using pseudo labeling  
- Image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset  
- Training with a blend of labeled and pseudo-labeled data  
- Accuracy tracking and performance visualization  
- Built with Keras/TensorFlow in a clean notebook format  

### 📁 File
- `PSEUDO CIFAR.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full training and evaluation process

### ✅ Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
